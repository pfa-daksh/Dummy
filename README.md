# DummyCONSULTANCY
In this project, I assumed the role of a dynamic consultancy firm, "Bold Consultancy," and took on the challenge of providing comprehensive guidance to a US steel manufacturer, Dorman Products. Their ambition? To venture into new territories across the globe, and that's where our journey began.

My primary objective was to equip Dorman Products with a well-researched analysis that would serve as the bedrock for their international endeavors. Within these files, you will find a treasure trove of insights and discoveries born out of meticulous research and thoughtful analysis.

With a relentless pursuit of excellence, I delved into market studies and data-driven evaluations, identifying key regions that offered immense potential for Dorman's expansion. Every step of the way, I considered an array of factors, leaving no detail unnoticed as we sculpted the perfect strategy.

As the project unfolded, I ensured that all aspects of the competitive steel market were taken into account. The result? A strategic M&A plan (Mergers and Acquisitions) that not only addressed challenges head-on but also unlocked countless opportunities for Dorman Products.

Throughout this journey, I channeled my passion for empowering businesses and embraced a forward-thinking approach to navigate complexities successfully. Each decision, analysis, and conclusion were anchored in dedication and a commitment to delivering exceptional value.
